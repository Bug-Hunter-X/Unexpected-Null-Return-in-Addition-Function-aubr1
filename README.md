# Unexpected Null Return in JavaScript Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving unexpected null returns from a simple addition function. The function `foo` is designed to add two numbers but returns `null` if either input is `null`.  This behavior might be unexpected and lead to subtle errors in applications.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a more robust solution that handles `null` values effectively.
